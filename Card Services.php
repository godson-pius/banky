                    If you own or operate a business, it pays to accept credit and debit cards. Most of your customers
                    will
                    appreciate the convenience that debit and credit cards provide. Many people no longer carry checks.
                    The average purchase tends to be higher when your customer pays with their debit/credit card, rather
                    than with cash or checks, thus increasing your sales. Our merchant credit/debit card vendor can
                    provide
                    equipment and service for debit/credit card acceptance payment for most any operating environment.
                    You will also receive competitive rates and pricing on equipment. <br><br>

                    Low rates, local service with worldwide access are advantages that a credit card from Horizon
                    Trustco
                    Bank has over an out-of-state credit card company. Many credit cards may offer you a low
                    "introductory" rate
                    then raise your rate after a few months. But SAPB offers you a consistently low rate MasterCard. At
                    SAPB you also
                    have the many advantages of local bank service. Local service means that you make your payments
                    right here at SAPB.
                    Local service also means you can speak to your SAPB loan officer when you need to increase your
                    credit line. <br><br>
                    You can shop locally or travel the world and with your MasterCard issued from Royal Union Bank.
                    Call today and speak with one of our loan officers for complete details about the local credit card
                    with worldwide access.

                    Some credit cards may also be able to get cash at our ATMs. This ATM access is dependent on how the
                    issuer of your
                    card has prepared your card.
